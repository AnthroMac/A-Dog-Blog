                           One thousand year old dog skeletons are found underneath the Parque de las Leyendas in Lima, Peru
                        </h2>

                    <div> <h3 class="post-subtitle"> <font size="2px"/>
                          Digging underneath the Parque de las Leyendas zoo, Karina Venegas Gutiérrez and her colleagues in the Division of Archaeology at the Parque de las Leyendas, unearthed 128 pre-Colombian dog skeletons buried alongside 128 human skeletons! The find of BOTH humans and dogs buried together was indicative of the important roles that dogs have long held to the people of Peru. 
Gutiérrez and her team of Archaeologists chose to make their information public, and it has been documented on many digital platforms. Information on their findings can be publicly accessed in various online journals, blogs, newspapers and has been shared through the various social media platforms such as on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. You can view photos and videos of the dogs remains as well as the actual archaeology site. Many people believe that these findings can provide great insight into the roles that dogs had for those living (and dying) in pre-Colombian Peru. Personally, I think this find is incredibly interesting and I’m glad it has been made available to the public, I believe we all have a right to access information and especially when it pertains to our past and our human ancestors, we can continue to learn a great deal about ourselves from our past and it is interesting to see the continuation or difference in the past beliefs, cultures and societies. These remains are now located at the Middendorf Museum and can be seen in person, or accessed online, watch <a href=" http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/mysterious-dog-sacrifice-dating-back-1000-years-discovered-peruvian-temple-1581310"><font color="red">here</font></a> 

Descending from the common street dogs still found roaming the streets today, they found canine skeletons ranging from small to quite large, one finding in particular that made my heart twinge is the skeleton showing an under-bite, suggesting a relation to a bulldog (I have a French-Bulldog mix, see “about me” section for photo). Positioned to look as though asleep, the dogs were all wrapped up in burial textiles, just as the humans, they were so well preserved, some still had skin and hair and even a few had their ears and noses. Radiocarbon dating has not been done yet, however, some objects located in the assemblage suggest a date of around 1000 C.E. Ancient dog cemeteries have been found in Peru, however this is different considering the human remains found alongside the dogs all appear to have been buried at approximately the same time and at random. Skull fractures and broken bones show signs of violence done to the humans, whereas the dogs have no such signs of abuse. One hypothesis detailed in <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/why-are-these-1000-year-old-dogs-buried-under-lima-zoo">Science Mag</a> states that Gutiérrez speculates “that the dogs were part of a ritual sacrifice, perhaps carried out hastily after a traumatic event in the community. “Maybe the dogs were offered to the humans after a mass death of some kind,” she said. As for who may have killed these people and why, she still can’t say.”
